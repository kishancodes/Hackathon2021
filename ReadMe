Here lies the files that I created during the UMSL Hackathon held from OCT 15-18.
I created the files in JAVA and used swing library to impose jFrame environment.
I used MySQL on my end to demonstrate the RDBMS module to store relational tables.
I did not create any tables as I had no time left and same goes around for some frames,
that were incomplete, had to just be used as is. So, please feel free to use it as
you all want.

Used JRE J Connector from MySQL.

Please change the password and the portnumber in the components package, according to
the one set in your device.
