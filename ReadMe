Here lies the files that I created during the UMSL Hackathon held from OCT 15-18.

We had to create a substance abuse reduction solution but I ended up creating something
else.

I created a centralized healthcare solution. LMAO.

This contains 3 app classess: for patient, doctor and the insurance company.
It utilizes a centralized relational database system with restrictions per app class.
I created the files in JAVA and used swing library to impose jFrame environment.
I used MySQL on my end to demonstrate the RDBMS module to store relational tables.
I did not create any tables, except for login windows, as I had no time left and 
same goes around for some frames, that were incomplete, had to just be used as is. 
So, please feel free to use it as you all want.

Used JRE J Connector from MySQL. Please attach it in the Libraries pacakge from
wherever you installed/stored it in your device.

Please change the password and the portnumber in the components package, according to
the one set in your device for MySQL.

There will be different header files for the Connection and the Statement files according
to the version of MySQL and the OS that you use. 

Look at the manual for futhur help:

The users can compile and create a standalone executable in Netbeans. 
Other IDEs like Intelli J or Eclipse don't provide the executable option.
If i'm wrong about executables, please lmk how to do the same on other IDEs.
Chur.
