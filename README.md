# UMSL-HACK-v5
Created a centralized medical system apps for:

- Insurance Companies
- Hospitals
- Patients
- Admins

Used Java Swing for GUI.

Configurators please change the link port and password to your local mysql
instance in the components directory per app directory for the JDBC connection.

- A lot of frames and tables are incomplete to be linked with each other.
- Login works for all the apps.
- Navigation to different frames work.
